      <t>Congestion control is an essential element in ensuring fair bandwidth
      usage and preventing congestion collapse for traffic sharing the
      Internet. For interactive real-time media traffic such as video
      conferencing, design of congestion control solution also needs to
      account for many other factors such as the requirement for low latency
      packet delivery and interactions with live video encoder. This document
      describes a common framework with the core functional building blocks
      for a real-time media congestion solutions.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>Given increasing amount of interactive real-time media traffic over
      the Internet, such as video conferencing, it is important that these
      applications employ proper congestion control mechanisms to avoid
      congestion collapse. <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-rmcat-cc-requirements"></xref> specifies the list of
      requirements of a viable solution.</t>

      <t>This document outlines a common framework for designing a congestion
      control mechanism for real-time interactive communication, so that individual
      drafts on specific solutions follow a consistent set of terminologies
      in describing their respective components. 
      <xref target="sec-functional-modules">The next section</xref> describes
      common functional modules in this framework,
      whereas <xref target="sec-example-config"></xref> provides examples
      on how these modules build together to support single and multiple
      media streams. </t>

     <t>[ Editor's note : This document does not describe the interaction
          between application, codec and congestion control system. 
          The interaction among application, codec and congestion control

    <section title="Functional Modules"
	     anchor="sec-functional-modules">

      <t>A viable solution for real-time media congestion control needs to
      comprise of several common modules. This section provides a brief
      description of them and their respective functionalities. A congestion
      control solution for real-time media should comprise of the described
      functional modules. This should help understanding different congestion
      control solutions.</t>

      <t><list style="symbols">

          <t>Network Congestion Controller : this is the core module for
          estimating available bandwidth over the network based on periodic
          RTCP feedback reports <xref target="RFC3550"></xref> from the
          receiver. This module contains key functions and calculations
          required to detect congestion and estimate available bandwidth
          on the transmission path based on the receiption quality of the
          media traffic. Different congestion control solutions employ
          different algorithms in detecting congestion and estimating
          available bandwidth for its media flow. It also possible that
          multiple media streams are multiplexed over a single transport,
          hence share a common congestion control module in aggregation.</t>

          <t>Transmission Queue : this module is needed to absorb the
          instantaneous mismatch between output from a live video encoder
          and regulated outgoing media flow. The transmission queue schedules
          outgoing traffic according to sending rate recommended by the rate
          controller module. It reports back its occupancy level to the rate
          controller module to assist future rate control decisions on
          target video rate, sending rate, and probing rate.</t>

          <t>Rate Controller : this module takes the estimated available
          bandwidth from the network congestion controller, shared states
          of other flows, as well as occupancy level of the transmission queue
          as input. It makes holistic decisions on: a) target video rate for
          the live video encoder; b) sending rate for regulating outgoing
          media flow(s) for the transmission queue; and c) rate of probing
          packets when needed. In the case where multiple media streams
          share a single transport and a common network congestion controller
          (for estimating available bandwidth in aggregation), the rate controller
          is also responsible for distributing available bandwidth amongst
          different media streams according to their relative priorities
          as well as share state information. When losses occur over the
          network and some previous media packets need to be retransmitted, 
          the rate controller should also account for the bandwidth needed
          for retransmission. </t>

          <t>Network Probe Generator: A congestion control solution can
          actively probe to estimate the available bandwidth on the media
          transmission path by sending more than what the live video encoder
          produces. Such an approach can be especially effective during the
          ramp up period of media and transmission rates, when no congestion
          has been observed over the network yet. The network probe generator
          is responsible for generating probing packets according to the
          probing rate specified by the rate controller. It can employ different
          techniques in doing so -- for example by generating simple dummy
          packets with unknown payload type or by generating Forward Error
          Correction (FEC) packets. While this document does not specify what
          probing technique to use or how those packets should be generated,
          a complete congestion control solution needs should specify total rate
          of the probe packets via the rate controller module.</t>

          <t>Live Video Encoder : the sender typically also contains a live
          video encoder, which adjusts the its encoding parameters according
          to the target video rate set by the rate controller. The output rate
          from the video encoder may deviate from this target due to uncertainty
          in the captured video content characteristics and the encoder rate
          control process. The output encoded media packets are fed to the
          transmission queue. Note that internal operations of the live video
          encoder (i.e., how video encoder rate control works) is out of scope
          for this document. </t>
       
         <t>Shared State: In the case of multiple media streams sharing a
            common sender hence a common network congestion controller,
            the sender should also contain a shared state module for
            storage and exchange of congestion control states [Editor's
            Note from Xiaoqing: examples of congestion control states??]
            amongst the multiple flows.</t>

        <t><xref target="fig-rmcat-solution-framework"></xref> shows an
        example configuration at the sender for supporting a single media
        stream. The Network Congestion Controller estimates available
        bandwidth based on periodic RTCP feedback reports. The Rate
        Controller takes as input the estimated available bandwidth (1)
        and the current occupancy level of the Transmission Queue (2).
        It calcuates as output sending rate (3) for the Transmission
        Queue, video target rate (4) for the Live Video Encoder,
        and probing rate (5)  -- if they are needed -- for the
        Network Probe Generator.  The Transmission Queue holds packets
        generated by both the Live Video Encoder and the Network Probe
        Generator; it paces transmission of its outgoing packets
        according to the sending rate (3) specified by Rate Controller.</t>

        <t>Obviously, it is possible for a congestion control solution
        to contain alternative configurations between these functional
        modules. [TODO: add one quick example on alternative wiring.]
        It is required that the candidate solution draft specify how
        their internal functional modules align to this framework.</t>

        <t><xref target="fig-rmcat-solution-multi-stream"></xref> shows an

        the aggregate estimated bandwidth (1) from the Network Congestion
